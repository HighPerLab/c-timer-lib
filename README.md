C Timer Header
--------------

Created for a research project to simplify the process of measuring runtimes.

This header file encapsulates the `clock_gettime` function and provides a
timing structure to measure time intervals. A few nice functions are provided
that can start and stop the timer and return the elapsed time in units of
seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, and nanoseconds.

The developer also has to option to select the system clock to be used and
also activate debugging facilities
